Assisted in generating method stubs, verifying formula accuracy for geometric areas, 
and demonstrating correct Java exception handling for invalid input values.

All formulas (area of circle, rectangle, triangle, square) are based on standard geometry principles.

Prompts:

“Write a Java class called AreaCalculator with overloaded methods to calculate the area of a circle, rectangle, triangle, and square. Each method should throw an IllegalArgumentException if any input is less than or equal to zero.”

“Show me how to implement overloaded methods in Java that calculate different shapes’ areas using the same method name but different parameter types.”
