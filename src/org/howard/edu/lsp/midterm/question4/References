“Help me design a smart-campus device system in Java with inheritance and interfaces.
The base abstract class should be Device, and subclasses should be DoorLock, Thermostat, and Camera.
Include interfaces Networked and BatteryPowered.”

“Show how to correctly extend an abstract class in Java and 
implement multiple interfaces with methods like connect(), disconnect(), and getStatus().”

“I need all my classes (Device, DoorLock, Thermostat, Camera) to compile and work with a provided Main.java file.
Can you show me how to structure the packages and method overrides correctly?”
